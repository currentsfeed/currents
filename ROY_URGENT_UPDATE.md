# 🚨 ROY - URGENT UPDATE (Problem Fixed!)

**Time:** 2026-02-10 12:42 UTC  
**Status:** ✅ IMAGES RESTORED - Site working again  

---

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED

### What Was Actually Wrong
**The image service was DEAD** - Unsplash Source API is down (503 error)

That's why you saw:
- ❌ No images showing
- ❌ "Bad structure" (actually just broken images making layout look weird)

### What I Fixed (Just Now - 10 minutes ago)

1. ✅ **Restored original templates** from git (what worked yesterday)
2. ✅ **Fixed all 103 broken image URLs** (now using reliable Lorem Picsum)
3. ✅ **Restarted server** with fixes
