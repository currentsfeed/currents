## 🚨 IF EMERGENCY CONTINUES

### Site Still Looks Bad?

1. **Check hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** completely
3. **Check URL** (make sure it's the ngrok URL)
4. **Check file timestamps** (should be recent)

### Changes Not Visible?

```bash
# Check files were modified
cd /home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/currents-full-local
ls -la templates/index-v2.html
# Should show today's date/time

# Check server is running
ps aux | grep "python3 app.py"
# Should show process

# Check server logs
tail -20 /tmp/currents-app.log
# Should show recent requests
```

### Restore Backup?

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/currents-full-local
cp .backups/roy-emergency-20260210-113934/* templates/
# Then restart server
```
