## 🚀 RECOMMENDATION

**Get the Pexels API key** (2 min signup) → **Run my script** (30 min) = **Done**

This is WAY faster than manual and guarantees:
- Topic-relevant images for every market
- Consistent quality (1600x900 professional photos)
- Proper keyword matching
- Zero manual work

**Alternative:** If you can't get API key for some reason, use the CSV checklist for manual downloads. I've made it as easy as possible.
