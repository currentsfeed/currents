# 🚨 ROY - READ THIS FIRST

**Status:** ✅ EMERGENCY FIXES COMPLETED  
**Time:** 2026-02-10 11:39 UTC  
**Result:** Site should look MUCH BETTER now  

---

## ⚡ WHAT I DID (15 minutes)

Fixed the 5 biggest visual problems:

1. **HERO SECTION** - Made it HUGE and dramatic (75% viewport height, 60px title)
2. **CARDS** - More breathing room (3 columns instead of 4, more padding)
3. **BELIEF CURRENTS** - Cleaner design (thicker bars, better spacing)
4. **CATEGORY BADGES** - Fixed styling (always readable now)
5. **OVERALL SPACING** - More generous throughout (60% increase)

**Plus:** Better card shadows with depth

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO NOW

### 1. Check the Live Site (2 minutes)

Go to: **https://proliferative-daleyza-benthonic.ngrok-free.dev**

**IMPORTANT:** Hard refresh!
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### 2. Quick Visual Check

Look for these changes:
- ✅ Hero is MUCH bigger (fills most of screen)
- ✅ Title is HUGE (60px, very prominent)
- ✅ Cards in 3 columns (not 4) - less cramped
- ✅ More space everywhere - easier to read
- ✅ Hover effects more dramatic (cards lift and shadow)

### 3. Give Feedback

**Option A: "Much better!"**
→ Great! We can fine-tune specifics if needed

**Option B: "Still looks off"**
→ Tell me EXACTLY what's wrong:
- "Hero title should be X px not Y px"
- "Cards should use color #XXXXXX"
- "Spacing should be Z px not W px"

**Option C: "It's the same / worse"**
→ Check if you hard-refreshed, or tell me and I'll troubleshoot

## 🎯 EXPECTED OUTCOME

**Your feedback should go from:**
- ❌ "looks awful"

**To:**
- ✅ "much better!" or "getting closer"

## 💡 NEXT STEPS (If Still Not Perfect)

For 95%+ visual match with Figma, I need exact values:

**From Figma, extract:**
1. Typography sizes (all heading/body sizes in px)
2. Color palette (exact hex codes)
3. Spacing system (margins, paddings, gaps in px)
4. Component dimensions (cards, badges, buttons)
5. Shadow definitions (layers, blur, spread)

**Or:** Share Figma screenshots with measurements overlaid

Then I can make surgical fixes to match exactly.
